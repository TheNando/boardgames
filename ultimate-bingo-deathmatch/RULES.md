### **Objective**

- Ultimate Bingo Deathmatch Arena is an arms-racing, lazor-blasting, BINGO-scoring showdown. Score cubes on your BINGO card by surviving combat rounds. Steal scored cubes from your opponents by reducing their health to zero. First person to score 5 cubes in a single row, column, or diagonal wins.

### **Overview***
Player each draws a Bingo chip from the bag and  places it in front of them. This is the space on their card they will score should they survive the round. Next, during the activating phase, players will simultaneously use a paper/rock/scissors-like gensture to indicate one of their 3 Item cards during the combat phase. The gestures are as follows: Fist to activate battery, guarding palm to activate shield, and finger pistol pointed at a target to activate Lazor. Finally, in the combat phase, all activated items will be resolved: Batteries allows for printing new items (aka aquiring upgraded cards from the center), Lazors deal damage to other players, and Shields potentially block predicted damage. If you survive, you get to score your card. If you are killed, the opponent who dealt the killing damage gets to score both his own and your BINGO chips. First to get a BINGO (complete 5 scored cells in a row) wins.

### **Setup**

- Each player selects a BINGO card and 40 Energon cubes of their color
- Each player sets their starting health to 3 by placing 3 Energon cubes in the health boxes at the top of their Bingo card
- Randomly select a player to go first and give that player the **First Turn** marker
- Each player starts with the following items face up in front of him:
  - Basic Lazor - Target other players during Combat phase to deal damage - Activate: Target takes 1 Dmg
  - Basic Shield - Raise shield during Combat phase to block some damage - Activate: Block 1 Dmg
  - Basic Battery - Acquire upgraded items from those available in the center, or generate and store an Overcharge for later use with non-basic Items
- Draw 1 item card per player, plus 1 to form the center row. These are the cards which may be aquired by using a battery card during combat.

### **Round Structure**

#### 1) Draw Phase

- Each player, starting with the first, draws a single BINGO chip from the bag and passes the bag to the next player until each has drawn
- Each player places their chip in front of their score card so each other player knows what will be scored

#### 2) Targeting Phase

On a three count, each player selects one of their 3 items (Lazor, Shield, or Battery) to use for that round. This is done simultaneously, as if playing Paper-Rock-Scissors.
They must end with the proper hand gesture in their palm to indicate which item they are using and their intended target, if applicable:

- **Prep** - All players make a fist with one hand and rest it on top of the other hand's face-up palm. This indicates you are ready to start the count
- **Count** - While counting to 3, all players raises fist then drops fist into palm on the counts of 1 and 2.
- **Target** - On the final count of 3, all players make the appropriate shape for which item they are using:
  - **Lazor** - Player makes a pistol shape with hand, targeting the player who will receive damage. That target takes damage, as indicated by the item card used, during the resolution phase.
  - **Shield** - Player chops and holds open hand into palm. Any applicable target(s) may be selected during the resolution phase, at the time that shield is resolved. Any received damage is modified as indicated on item card used.
  - **Battery** - Player keeps hand in fist, resting it in palm of other hand. Battery card effects take place. Any damage received as result of being targeted by other players applies to health, in full.
- **Overcharge** - If a player has sufficient Overcharge stored from a previous round, they may now choose to expend it to activate an item's Overcharged ability. To indicate to the other players that you have activated your Overcharge, you must state loudly and exuberantly "Ohhhhhhhhhhh!" (for "O"vercharge). The player has about 2-3 seconds after throwing their gesture to determine whether to activate an Overcharge. This is left fuzzy intentionally, because it's more fun that way.

#### 3) Combat Resolution

1. Resolve Batteries: If your activated battery has any additional effects, they are now active. However, item aquisition is not handled until the final step

2. Resolve Lazors: All Lazors are fired simultaneous and resolved in player turn order. There is no way to prevent a player from firing their Lazor. Even if killed prior to resolving their fire, the Lazor still activates and that player is still eligible to earn a kill.

3. Resolve Damage:
   _ Starting from the **First Player** and going clockwise, if player fired his or her Lazor, apply damage to their target.
   _ Damage is first applied to target's shield then any remainder is applied to health.

4. Resolve Shields:
   _ If target activated his or her shield, shield effects are applied at the moment of impact. This may cause a cascading effect of more damage. Resolve each damage instance individually, in turn order.
   _ Unless otherwise noted, the shield has a set number of damage it can block for the whole turn. \* Ex. If a shield blocks 3 damage and 2 players target that shield for 2 damage each, the first shot will reduce the shield from 3 HP down to 1 and the second shot will reduce the shield to 0 with 1 HP excess, which will then apply to the player's health.

5. Resolve Deaths:
   _ The moment a player's health is reduced to 0 points, that player is killed. The player who dealth the killing damage will capture the targets Bingo chip to score it. Captured chips cannot be recaptured if another player kills the player that captured it in the same turn. They will only get that player's drawn chip.

6. Resolve aquisitions:
   _ Any player that activated a battery, starting with the **First Player**, may now choose to aquire any of the available cards from the center row
   _ When a card is purchased, it is immediately replaced with a new card drawn from the deck.
   _ Purchasing an item card replaces the current item of that type. \* Ex. Vampiric Lazor would replace the Basic Lazor, or any previously purchased Lazor.
   _ Power Cards do not replace any previously purchased cards. There is no limit to how many Power Cards a player may have
   _ Repeat with other battery activating players in a clockwise rotation
   _ The last player to purchase may choose to wipe all the available cards and replace them with newly drawn cards prior to making their selection.
   
### **Winning/End of Game**
The first player to have a completed BINGO (5 scored cubes in a row) at the end of a round wins. Note that there are many ways other players may manipulate or steal scored cubes before the round ends, at which point, if no player still has a BINGO, play continues to the next round.
