### **Setup**

- Each player selects a player BINGO card, a set of BINGO dice, and 40 Energon cubes, each of their color
- Each player sets their starting health to 3 by placing 3 Energon cubes in the health boxes at the top of their Bingo card
- Randomly select a player to go first and give that player the **First Turn** marker
- Each player starts with the following items face up in front of him:
  - Basic Lazor - Target other players during Combat phase to deal damage - Activate: (2E) Target takes 1 Dmg
  - Basic Shield - Raise shield during Combat phase to block some damage - Activate: (2E) Block 1 Dmg
  - Basic Battery - Grants Energon at the start of the round. Activate during the Combat phase to generate additional Energon. Each battery has a maximum capacity and excess Energon is lost at the end of the round. - Passive: Generate 2E at the start of the round. - Activate: Generate 2E - Lose any energy in excess of 4E at the end of the round.

### **Objective**

- Ultimate Bingo Deathmatch Arena is part gunfight battle showdown, part race to make a BINGO. Score cubes on your BINGO card by rolling dice each round. Steal scored cubes from your opponents by reducing their health to zero. First person to score 5 cubes in a single row or column on their BINGO card wins.

### **Round Structure**

#### 1) Charge

- All batteries generate E as according to their passive charge rating. Place that many Energon cubes from your cube pool onto your battery at the start of the round.

#### 2) BINGO Roll

- Each player rolls their set of BINGO dice
- Based on the roll, each player places a cube from their pool on their BINGO grid in the appropriate column and row. This is called "scoring" a block
- If either dice land with the Star face up, you may score on any space along that row or column. \* Ex. Rolling a N and Star allows you to score in any space along the N column, N1, N2, N3, N4, or N5. Rolling a Star 2 would allow you to score in any space along the 2 row, B2, I2, N2, G2, or O2. Rolling 2 Stars allows you to score on any space!
- If a block is scored on a "Charged" space, add 1 Energon to your battery from your pool. Charged spaces how a colored outline around them
- If a block would be scored on a space that has already been scored, add 1 Energon to your battery. Add 2 Energon, in total, if that space is Charged as well.

#### 3) Combat

**Targeting**

On a three count, each player selects one of their 3 items (Lazor, Shield, or Battery) to use for that round. This is done simultaneously, as if playing Paper-Rock-Scissors.
They must end with the proper hand gesture in their palm to indicate which item they are using and their target if applicable:

- **Pre-count** - All players make a fist with one hand rested in a flat, upward facing palm with the other.
- **Count** - While counting to 3, all players raises fist then drops fist into palm on the counts of 1 and 2.
- **Select** - On the final count of 3, all players make the appropriate shape for which item they are using:
  - **Lazor** - Player makes a pistol shape with hand, targeting the player who will receive damage. That target takes damage, as indicated by the item card used, during the resolution phase.
  - **Shield** - Player sets palm flat and perpendicular to other palm as if chopping into palm. Any target(s) may be selected during the resolution phase, at the time that shield is resolved. Any received damage is modified as indicated on item card used.
  - **Battery** - Player keeps hand in fist, resting it in palm of other hand. Battery card effects take place. Any damage received as result of being targeted by other players applies to health, in full.
- **Overcharge** - If a player has sufficient Energon charged, they may choose to activate their item with an Overcharged activation at the moment of selecting their item, give or take a couple seconds. To indicate to the other players that you have activated your Overcharge, you must state loudly and exuberantly "Ohhhhhhhhhhh!" Be sure to spend the correct amount for your activation cost.

**Resolution**

1. Resolve Activation Costs and Batteries - All players:
   _ Resolve Energon spent activating their item
   _ Gain Energon generated from Battery activation \* Resolve Battery effects, in turn order, starting with the **First Player** token

2. Fire Lazors \* All Lazors are fired. There is no way to prevent a player from firing their Lazor. Even if killed prior to resolving their fire, the Lazor still activates and that player is still eligible to earn a kill.

3. Apply Damage to Targets
   _ Starting from the **First Player** and going clockwise, if player fired his or her Lazor, apply damage to their target.
   _ Damage is first applied to target's shield then any remainder is applied to health.

4. Shields
   _ If target activated his or her shield, resolve all shield effects immediately. This may cause a cascading effect of more damage. Resolve each damage instance individually, in turn order.
   _ Unless otherwise noted, the shield has a set number of damage it can block for the whole turn. \* Ex. If a shield blocks 3 damage and 2 players target that shield for 2 damage each, the first shot will reduce the shield from 3 HP down to 1 and the second shot will reduce the shield to 0 with 1 HP excess, which will then apply to the player's health.

5. Resolve Deaths
   _ If a player's health is reduced to 0 points, that player is killed. The killed player chooses and rolls one of his or her two dice. The player that delivered the killing shot may steal any scored cube from that column or row indicated by the roll and score it to the exact same location on their board.
   _ Ex. If killed player chooses his letter die and rolls an N, then the attacker can pick any scored cube from the N column and score it to his card in the corresponding space.

- Any blocks scored this way follow the same rules as in the BINGO phase.

#### 3) Purchase

- Starting with the **First Player**, players may choose to purchase any item available, spending the Energon cost listed at the top right of the cost. This comes from their Battery charge. If they do not have enough Energon stored on their battery to meet the cost on the card, they may not purchase that card.
- When a card is purchased, it is immediately replaced with a new card drawn from the deck.
- Purchasing an item card replaces the current item of that type. \* Ex. Vampiric Lazor would replace the Basic Lazor, or any previously purchased Lazor.
- Power Cards do not replace any previously purchased cards. There is no limit to how many Power Cards a player may have
- Repeat with other players in a clockwise rotation
- The last player to purchase may choose to wipe all the available cards and replace them with newly drawn cards prior to making their selection.
